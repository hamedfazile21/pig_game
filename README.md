## 🕹️ How to Play

1. **Goal**: Be the first player to reach the target score (default is 100).
2. **Gameplay**:
   - Players take turns rolling a dice.
   - If the dice shows a number other than `1`, that number is added to the player's current score for the turn.
   - Players can choose to "Hold," which adds their current score to their total score and ends their turn.
   - If the dice rolls a `1`, the player's current score is reset, and their turn ends immediately.
3. **Winning**: The first player to reach or exceed the target score wins the game.
